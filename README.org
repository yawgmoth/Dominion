* Purpose
This program is an implementation of the card game Dominion by Donald X. Vaccarino.

* Features
 - Base game cards are all implemented
 - Slightly awkward command line user interface implemented
 - Only "no provinces left" is implemented as game end condition
 - Random selection of kingdom cards
 - Two-player game
 
* Usage
 - The most interesting way to use it right now is for simulations of many games
 - e.g. python trial.py -1 ai.random -2 ai.expensive (Run 1000 games of random vs expensive AIs and report stats)
 - e.g. python trial.py -1 ai.random -2 ai.expensive -o load=state.save (Run 1000 games of random vs expensive AIs starting in the state described in state.save)
 - python dominion.py -1 ai.random -2 ai.buylist -o kingdom=Village;Market;Smithy -b graph=True (Run a game of random vs. buylist; the buylist AI will simulate 100 games every turn that start in the current state and will plot the stats afterwards)

* Todos
 - Proper game ending (When 3 action stacks are exhausted, too)
 - More notifications for players (what the opponent is doing)
 - Better user interface (GUI!)
 - User interface proxy for playing over network
 - AI
 - More card sets
 - More options: Force inclusion/exclusion of kingdom cards, make preset lists available, ...
